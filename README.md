# 🔤 Jayden's LINE Patches

A custom font patch for LINE. Compatible with Morphe.

## ❓ About

`[General] Custom font` sets a font file from your device as the font of LINE's themes.
Select the patch, then give the full path of a `.ttf`, `.otf` or `.ttc` file in its "Font file" option.

Text that LINE draws without a theme font, such as Jetpack Compose screens, can keep the system font.
